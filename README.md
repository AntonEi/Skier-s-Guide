### Browser Testing

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari browsers with no issues noted.

### Device Testing

- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone 8, iPhoneX and iPad to ensure responsiveness on various screen sizes. The website performed as intended. The responsive design was also checked using Chrome developer tools across multiple devices with structural integrity holding for the various sizes.
- I also used the following websites to test responsiveness:
  -  [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fantonei.github.io%2FSkier-s-Guide%2Findex.html)
  - [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://antonei.github.io/Skier-s-Guide/index.html)

### Friends and Family User Testing
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Fixed Bugs
#### Add font awesome to all pages 

- During the recent development of my website, I encountered an unexpected challenge with the navigation toggle button not displaying as intended. After thorough investigation, I identified the root caused by a missing Font Awesome library in the bottom of the rest of the pages.
  
#### Hr was blocking p
  - During the recent validation of our CSS, the validator alerted us to an unclosed p segment. After meticulous inspection, I traced the issue back to an unexpected hr tag within the paragraph. Realizing that the validator doesn't allow an hr element in between the opening and closing p tags, I promptly corrected the structure, ensuring adherence to best practices.
